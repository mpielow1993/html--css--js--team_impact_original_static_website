			<p>&lsquo;I flew in from Manchester on holiday visiting family in Ennis and trained here for a week. Classes were superb 
			and everyone there could not be more welcoming. Made me and my daughter feel very welcome. Looking forward to going back!&rsquo;</p>

			<p>&lsquo;I just visited from the US and was very interested in checking out Team Impact. I came just in time to do the no-gi BJJ 
			class with Michael. He was awesome to work with as even though he had a whole class to focus on, he still had time to work with me even 
			though I was just a day pass guest. Their members are very lucky to have such a respectable gym to train at. Thank you Team 
			Impact for the great experience! I'll definitely be back here on my next trip to Ireland! Cheers!&rsquo;</p>

			<p>&lsquo;Best place to train in Ireland imo. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Atmosphere is great, everybody is really friendly 
			and approachable. Gym is open from early am to late pm which is great as classes run throughout the day. I have trained in numerous 
			MMA gyms over the years and this one is by far the best.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>&lsquo;I have practiced martial arts for 26 years and can honestly say that Team Impact is the perfect mix for anyone looking to take
			part in martial arts. Whether a beginner or experienced practitioner, the club caters for both perfectly with a great atmosphere, 
			great coaches and a great class schedule. Get in and get started. You'll look back and realize it was one of the best choices you&apos;ve 
			ever made.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>&lsquo;The quality of instructors and training at Team Impact is second to none. I have trained in other gyms but would never consider 
			going anywhere else now!&rsquo;</p>

			<p>&lsquo;Train with one of the top teams in the country and be the best you can be. Rich has a wealth of knowledge and is eager to share 
			it and the proof is easy to see. He has developed guys who have won tonnes of local, regional and international medals and titles in
			numerous disciplines. Being part of this team not only makes you a better fighter, it makes you a better person. In order to achieve 
			success you will travel a journey and along the way you will find that the person who started no longer exists but instead has changed 
			into someone extraordinary. Proud to be part of Team Impact.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>&lsquo;By far one of the best places I have ever trained. Everyone is friendly, accommodating and eager to make sure you learn martial arts 
			the right way! Everyone in this gym is tough but they are some of the best people I have come across in all my travels. When I am in 
			Ireland, this is my home! The head coach Rich Jones has a wealth of knowledge and embodies the principles of Loyalty, Honour and Respect. 
			Great gym, great coach, great group of guys!&rsquo;</p>
				<h4>-Marie Burgess, Toronto, Ontario, Canada</h4>

			<p>&lsquo;I joined Team Impact to further my career in MMA and they have already helped me do that. I wish I joined sooner, Rich is a very 
			intelligent and professional coach and all members live and breathe his ethos. Great family environment too with many parents and their 
			children training there.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>&lsquo;I only came up to try one class. Five years later I&apos;m now training full time and I wouldn&apos;t change it for the world! The atmosphere in
			the gym is great and classes run pretty much all day! I train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Boxing, Muay Thai and Wrestling. The coaches have always
			been super helpful and supportive from Beginner level to where I am today! I met all of my friends through Team Impact. Joining this gym was 
			one of the best decisions I ever made.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>&lsquo;The guys down in the gym couldn&apos;t be more welcoming! Before training starts you&apos;d have no idea which fighters are pros and who&apos;s just 
			beginning on their own journey; it&apos;s one of the few gyms where egos are truly left at the door. The training itself is as good as it gets. 
			World-class technique. It's an honour to train at such an awesome and unique facility.&rsquo;</p>
				<h4>-Martin McAdams, Ennis, Ireland</h4>

			<p>&lsquo;The gym has a great atmosphere, the training is great. Each class is run by professional trainers with years of experience in combat sports. 
			I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to learn self-defence :)&rsquo;</p>
