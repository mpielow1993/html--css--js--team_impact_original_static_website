			<h2>What is Wrestling?</h2>
				<p>Wrestling is an ancient martial art that uses grappling type techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns, joint locks, pins 
				and other grappling holds. A wrestling bout is a physical competition, generally between two people, who attempt to gain and maintain a 
				superior position. Wrestling is one of the oldest of martial arts with references to it as early as the Iliad that recounts the Trojan War 
				in the 13th or 12th century BC. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules with both traditional historic and modern styles. 
				Wrestling techniques have been incorporated into other martial arts as well as military hand-to-hand combat systems.</p>
				<p>The rapid rise in the popularity of <a href="MMA.html">Mixed Martial Arts</a> (MMA) has increased interest in wrestling due to its proven 
				effectiveness in MMA contests. It is considered one of four core disciplines in MMA together with <a href="Boxing.html">Boxing</a>, 
				<a href="MuayThai.html">Muay Thai</a> and <a href="BJJ.html">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a>. Already in the early stages of MMA development, 
				wrestling gained respect due to its effectiveness against traditional martial artists. Wrestlers Dan Severn, Don Frye, Mark Coleman, 
				Randy Couture and Mark Kerr went on to win early Ultimate Fighting Tournaments. Ken Shamrock won the first UFC Superfight Championship in 
				the <a href="http://uk.ufc.com/" target="_blank">UFC</a> and was also the first King of Pancrase in Japan.</p>
				<p>Successful fighters in modern MMA who began their training in various forms of wrestling include former UFC Lightweight Champion 
				Frankie Edgar, 2000 Olympic silver medallist Yoel Romero, 2009 world champion and ONE FC Welterweight Champion Ben Askren, former Olympic 
				wrestler and UFC Light Heavyweight &amp; Heavyweight Champion Daniel Cormier, former 2000 NCAA wrestling champion UFC Heavyweight Champion 
				Brock Lesnar and former Pride FC Middleweight and Light Heavyweight Dan Henderson.</p>
